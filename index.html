        <p class="hist_content"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Nigeria, officially Federal Republic of Nigeria. Country, western Africa. 
            Area: 356,669 sq mi (923,768 sq km). 
            Population: (2021 est.) 225,954,000. 
            Capital: Abuja. 
            There are more than 250 ethnic groups, including Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo. 
            Languages: English (official), Hausa. 
            Religions: Christianity (Protestant, other Christians, Roman Catholic), Islam, traditional beliefs.

        <p class="hist2_content">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When Nigeria achieved independence from British colonial rule on
October 1, 1960, the prospects appeared promising and expectations for
the future of the country were high. Nigeria was the most populous
country in Africa, and the potential for economic growth was great,
buoyed largely by the discovery of commercial quantities of petroleum in
the Niger delta region in 1958. Nigeria was dubbed the ‘‘Giant of Africa,’’
and many people both inside and outside the country believed that
Nigeria would soon rise to claim a leading position in African and world
affairs. Nigeria also saw itself as a beacon of hope and progress for other
colonized peoples emerging from the yoke of alien rule. By 1970, however, Nigeria’s stability and prestige had been greatly damaged by a
decade of political corruption, economic underdevelopment, and military
coups. Most damaging, however, was the culmination of these problems
in a two-and-a-half-year civil war from 1967 to 1970 that rent the country
along regional and ethnic lines, killed between 1 and 3 million people, and
nearly destroyed the fragile federal bonds that held together the Nigerian
state.
        </p>
        <p class="hist3_content">
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The underlying cause of all the problems that Nigeria experienced in
the 1960s and has experienced since then is what is often called the
‘‘national question.’’1 What is Nigeria? Who are Nigerians? How does a
country go about developing a meaningful national identity? The geographical area now known as Nigeria was created by the British colonial
administration in 1914, not by indigenous peoples themselves. Thereafter,
the people within the borders of Nigeria were known to the world as
‘‘Nigerians,’’ but in reality this designation meant little to most people,
whose lives continued to be primarily centered on local communities that
had existed for hundreds and thousands of years. The regional and federal
emphases of the constitutions of the 1950s further undermined the

development of a unified national consciousness by determining that
access to power at the national level was to be derived from holding
power at the regional level. The largest ethnic groups in each region – the
Hausa/Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo in the Northern, Western, and Eastern
Regions respectively – therefore came to dominate their respective regions
and to contest for power at the federal level.

            What you’re seeing is the Nigerian Coat of Arms, 
            one more national symbol that carries profound meaning. 
            It was created and adopted in May 1960.
            The Coat of Arms consists of the images that express different meanings: Black shield and colorful wreath over the shield stand for fertile soil of Nigeria; 
            White horses mean dignity; 
            Red Eagle is for the strength of the nation; 
            White lines in the “Y” shape stand for two main rivers of Nigeria: Benue and Niger; 
            Yellow Trumpet or Costus Spectabilis is the national flower of Nigeria. 
            The flower is placed on the ground where the shield is standing. 
            It represents the beauty of the country and its nation; “Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress” line beneath the shield is the Nigerian national motto. 
            It was adopted in 1978. The purpose is to inspire the nation to be united, faithful, live in peace and grow, become wiser and stronger.

<!-- ..................Overview of the three main tribes................... -->
<p class="overview">One of the main diversifying feature of Nigeria is the fact that the country is dominated by so many different ethnic groups and tribes. 
    I bet you don’t know that there are at least 350 tribes in Nigeria.

    Three major ethnic groups dominate Nigeria. 
    These ethnic groups are so large that they amount for over 70% of the entire ethnic groups in the country 
    -I’m guessing you already know which three ethnic groups I’m referring to.</p>

    <h3 class="title">IGBO</h3>
    <p class="text">
        The Ibo or Igbo people are found in southeastern Nigeria. 
        With a population of around 40 million throughout Nigeria, 
        they are one of the biggest and most influential tribes. 
        The Igbo people are found everywhere in the world. 
        As a result of their “hustling spirit’’ and their drive to succeed, 
        they migrate to other places to either start-up or expand their business.
        The Igbo culture has many unique customs, festivals, and ways of life. 
        which they hold in high esteem, this is why wherever they find themselves; 
        their culture and way of life tend to follow.

    <p class="text">
        The Yoruba people live on the west coast of Africa
in Nigeria and can also be found in the eastern
Republic of Benin and Togo. Because the majority
of the slaves brought to the Americas were from
West Africa, Yoruban descendants can also be found
in Brazil, Cuba, the Caribbean, and the United
States. The Yoruba are one of the
largest cultural groups in Africa. They created a strong
economy through farming, trading, and art
production.
The Yoruba are a very sociable and expressive people who commemorate major events with colorful festivals and celebrations.

        The Hausa, numbering more than 20 million, are the largest ethnic group in west Africa. 
        They are widely distributed geographically and have intermingled with many different people.
        Hausa is the most widely spoken language in west Africa. It is spoken by an estimated 22 million people. 
        Another 17 million people speak Hausa as a second language. 
        Hausa is written in Arabic characters, and about one-fourth of Hausa words come from Arabic.
        Hausa are also famous as long-distance traders and local vendors of Hausa-made leather goods as well as tourist items.

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p id="foodie" >
        Nigeria is in West Africa, and some of our closest neighbors are Ghana, Benin, and Cameroon. 
        Our foods are quite similar, and we eat a lot of fufu with soups (African stews) and rice dishes.
        We have slight variances in how we prepare Nigerian foods, and there has been a long-running battle whether Ghana or Nigeria makes the best Jollof rice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nigerians practice nose-to-tail eating, which means no part of the animal goes to waste! 
        We use offal meat (kidney, liver, intestine, tripe) to make pepper soup, a very popular delicacy at parties. 
        We also love to eat beef, goat meat, lamb, chicken, turkey, you name it. 
        The most popular vegetables are Lagos spinach (efo shoko), African spinach (efo tete), bitter leaves, pumpkin leaves (ugwu), water leaves, jute leaves (ewedu), and scent leaves (efirin).
        Most of these leaves are specific to particular regions of the country and used to prepare their native dishes, usually a form of stew or soup. 
        Most people eat a vegetable stew dish several times a week.
        Our foods are quite hot and spicy and always very flavorful. 
        Almost everything we make contains dry ground pepper (similar to cayenne pepper) and Maggi cubes (our brand of bouillon cubes).

<h3 class="chops">Small Chops</h3>
<p>
    In Nigeria, finger foods are popularly referred to as small chops. 
    Back in the day, these were limited to Battered Fish, Mini Sausage Rolls, Snails, Peppered Gizzards, Barbecued Goat Meats (Asun), Puff Puffs etc.
But these days, some imported world recipes have joined the Nigerian Small Chops family. These include: Samosa and Spring Rolls.
Most times, these acts as appetizers, main course or even desserts. Often served at events like birthday parties, weddings and even funerals.

    <p class="info">Most times, when people talk about Nigeria, they instantly think about the bad parts of the country thanks to media outlets and other social media, but I am here to tell you that Nigeria has so much more to offer than bad roads and corruption. The Nigerian culture has alot of fascinating features than you could imagine like for one, our music which we call AFROBEAT is renowned world-wide, our hairstyles are to die for and even our languages have reached the ears and mouths of many Non-Nigerians.
